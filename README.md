This software is not in its final form yet and this software shall only be used for educational purposes only!!! and I am not responsible for any malicious or evil use of this software and not responsible for any legal issues too!!! so use it with your own risk and this software is just made for fun and development can stop at any time!.

To run the software:
1. clone this git bun reprosotory for ease of use and ignore step 2 but still perform step 3.
2. create a new folder known as human face recogniton script and also create a Python Virtual Environment and add the following pip modules in it by downloading and installing them the modules are: face_recognition , opencv-python , numpy , PyQt5.
3. To run the python virtual enviroment and also to create it just go to this website: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/creating-python-virtual-environment-windows-linux/  and this github repository already has an python virtual enviroment called .venv , activate the virtual enviroment by going into human-face-recognition-script\.venv\Scripts folder and typeing .\activate in windows powershell (also dont forget to set the windows powershell execution policy value to allow for the execution of this script) and then type this command in the terminal:
 " pip install face_recognition opencv-python numpy PyQt5 " to install the required modules and librarys.
4. run the encode_faces.py program in the terminal with the command "python encode_faces.py" which will generate new files for the next python script "python recognize_faces.py".
5. then run the recognize_faces.py program in the terminal with the command "python recognize_faces.py"
